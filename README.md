# Proj4 Keith and Larry

## Contributions

Larry worked on the reading in from stdin, creating the Map struct, and creating an adjacency list

Keith worked on dijkstras(), created the edge struct, and printing out the correct paths and total cost

## Questions

1 - We used an adjacency list to store the vertices and edges. The neighbors of a node would be the tiles up, down, left, and right of it.

2 -  O((V+E)log V).
Adjacency List: represents graph connections and weights. O(n)

Priority Queue: Manages nodes based on their shortest known distances using a min-heap. O(logn)

Distance Array: Tracks the shortest known distance to each node. O(n)

Ideal Edges Array: Records the shortest pathâ€™s predecessors for path reconstruction.
